          <p>
            As my first blog post here on my site, I figure I should make it about what I'm hoping to do in the future.
            I intend to become a game developer; it is something I've dreamt of for many years. Game development
            is an important form of art (in my opinion, at least), and over the span of around 40-50 years, it
            has changed the way many people see the world they live in.
            Games can combine many art forms into one - literature, visual art, music - and turn it
            into a personal experience that the user gets to become a part of. Not to mention, the amount of depth and loving
            care that is put into these programs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have great respect for indie game developers. They take on large, complex projects, often in short
            spans of time, with few people (sometimes only one!) and they make games that are oftentimes more interesting
            than the newest big releases every year. The fulfillment one must get from doing things like that is one of the
            reasons why I want to become a game developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm excited for what I will create in the future, and if you take interest in what I'm doing - I hope my work does something
            good for you.
